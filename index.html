  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi, I’m Doug. I am an early-career engineer who graduated from Iowa State University with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering in May, 2023. My focus was on microwave electronics but I also put a heavy emphasis on analog integrated circuit design. Currently, I work for IBM as a hardware developer.</p>

<p>In my free time, I work on a variety of projects. My projects usually focus on 3D printing and electronics, but I am trying to expand my knowledge. This site is where I discuss my latest experiences and projects.</p>

<h2 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>IBM</em></strong>

      <li>
        <p><strong>PLL Hardware Designer (2023 - Current)</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>PLL Hardware Design Intern (Summer 2022)</strong></p>

        <p><!-- On-site internship with IBM in their I/O group for P- and Z-Series systems. As an intern with IBM, I was primarily responsible for revising PLL shutdown logic to improve power efficiency after system startup. Additionally, I aided in testing wafers containing test circuits by improving SPI communication tools, implementing level-correction for test equipment, and automating common tests. --></p>

  <li><strong><em>Texas Instruments</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Analog Design Engineering Intern (Summer 2021)</strong></p>

        <p><!-- Remote internship with TI in the precision amplifiers group. As a first-time design intern, I was responsible for verifying amplifier designs pre- and post-layout to confirm the designs satisfied specifications across process corners and random variation. --></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Test and Validation Engineering Intern (Summer 2020)</strong></p>

        <p><!-- Remote internship with TI in the precision amplifiers group. Over summer, I developed an ATE handler interface board (HIB) that allowed for efficient testing of an upcoming electrometer-grade product. The HIB was capable of measuring currents in the femtoamp range.  Additionally, I researched methods of charactierzing electrometer-grade devices. --></p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>EE 435 Teaching Assistant (Spring 2021)</strong></p>

        <p><!-- EE 435 is ISU's undergraduate introductory course for analog IC design and focusses primarily on op-amp design. As the course TA, my primary responsibility was to adapt labs for virtual instruction, create homework solutions, grade homework and labs, guide students in their final projects, and help students understand content they were struggling with.  --></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>EE 330 Teaching Assistant (Fall 2021, Spring 2020, Fall 2019)</strong></p>

        <p><!-- EE 330 is ISU's undergraduate introductory course into integrated circuits and covers topics such as fabrication, modelling of common semiconductors, design of small signal amplifiers, and considerations of digital circuits. As the course TA, I was responsible for creating homework problems and solutions, maintaining the course's labs, and helping students understand content. On several occasions I acted as a guest lecturer when the course instructor was unavailable. --></p>
